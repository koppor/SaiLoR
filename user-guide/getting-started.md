# Getting started

## The three-pane layout

Once a project is open, the screen is three panes: your **papers** on the left, the **PDF** in the
middle, and the **annotation form** on the right, built from the project's schema.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/annotate-overview.png" alt="The annotation view: paper list on the left, PDF in the middle, annotation form on the right" width="900">
</p>

- **Pick a paper** from the left list to load its PDF and its form.
- **Read the PDF** in the middle; its text is selectable, and **Ctrl/Cmd+F** searches within it.
  Hovering an internal link (a citation, a figure reference) previews its target. For a reference,
  the preview also shows whether [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) already has it in an open library
  (green: yes, olive: in another open library, grey ring: no), and **Ctrl/Cmd+J** adds it to the
  current JabRef library — enable JabRef's HTTP server first (*Preferences → Network → HTTP server*,
  port 23119).
- **Fill in the form** on the right. Repeatable fields (like *Findings* above) show **+ Add** and a
  remove (**×**) control for each entry.
- **Save** via the *Save* menu, or **Ctrl/Cmd+S**. *Save as…* writes to a new location and
  re-derives every PDF reference so they keep resolving from there.

If the project is set up for **screening** instead of full annotation, this pane shows a title/abstract
record and an Include/Exclude choice instead — see [Screening](screening.md). If it's set up for
**multiple reviewers**, you'll be asked which seat you are before you can annotate anything — see
[Working with several reviewers](multi-reviewer.md).

## Finding a paper

The box above the paper list searches **title, authors, DOI, abstract, the PDF's file name, and the
paper's own id** by default (the **META** trigger on the right edge of the box). Click that trigger to
switch to **TAGS**, which searches the **annotation content** you've already recorded instead — useful
for "which papers did I mark as X".

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/paper-search.png" alt="Searching the paper list for 'A1-37', a PDF's file name, and finding the one matching paper" width="900">
</p>

The search above matches `A1-37` — part of a PDF's *file name*, not its title or authors — and still
finds the right paper. Searching by the paper's own id works the same way; both are useful once a
project has more papers than you can recognize by title alone.

Annotation-content search looks at *your own* current seat's answers, so in a multi-reviewer project
it finds your work, not somebody else's.

## Grabbing text straight from the PDF

Select any text in the PDF, then click the **⧉** button next to a field to insert exactly that
selection into it. Numeric fields pull out the first number in the selection.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/grab-from-pdf-selection.png" alt="Text selected in the PDF, ready to be grabbed into an annotation field" width="900">
</p>

This is the fastest way to fill in most fields without retyping anything from the paper — select the
sentence that supports a claim, click ⧉ next to *Claim*, done.

## Highlighting and commenting in the PDF

Select text in the PDF and a small color toolbar appears — pick a color to highlight the selection
and open a note box for it right away, or press **a** to use the first color without reaching for the
mouse. A selection that runs onto the next page becomes one continuous highlight instead of stopping
at the page break; a running header or footer caught in that spillover is left out automatically,
though selecting into one yourself still highlights it. Click any existing highlight later to reopen
that box: change its color, edit or clear the note, or delete it. Press **Escape**, click elsewhere, or
scroll the page to close the box without deleting anything.

Hovering a highlight or note (without clicking) shows its comment — or, for a highlight with no
comment, the text it covers — plus any fields it's linked to, in a small tooltip, so you can check
what a mark is without opening it. **Ctrl/Cmd+scroll** zooms the PDF in and out. Deleting a highlight
or note that's linked to one or more fields asks you to confirm first, naming which fields would lose
their evidence.

These highlights and notes are your own — in a multi-reviewer project, each reviewer (and
Consolidation) sees only their own marks, just like annotation answers. They're saved with the
project like everything else, but on their own file per paper per reviewer, so two people marking up
the same PDF never conflict in git.

**More annotation tools.** The 📝 button in the PDF header opens a row of annotation tools below it:

- A post-it button for dropping a sticky note anywhere on the page — click the button, then click
  the spot in the PDF, and the note's comment box opens right away.
- ‹ › buttons to step through every highlight and note on the paper, in reading order, jumping
  straight to each one's exact spot on the page (not just the top of the page it's on).
- A 📤 button (enabled once you have at least one highlight or note) that exports the PDF with your
  marks burned in as real PDF annotation objects any PDF reader can show — for sharing outside
  SaiLoR. Choose to save it as a new file (the default) or overwrite the paper's own PDF in place;
  the app warns before the second option, since that file is shared with every other reviewer and
  overwriting it is likely to cause a git conflict.

**Linking a highlight or note to a field.** Next to every annotation field is a small 🔗 button —
click it to record why you picked this value. It opens a box showing what's already linked (or "No
links yet"); click **+ Link a highlight or note** to fold out a scrollable list of the paper's other
highlights and notes, with a search box at the bottom if there are a lot of them. That list is sorted
with up to 3 highlights/notes you made *this session* first, most recent first (a little extra space
marks where that group ends), then everything else in reading order down the paper — a highlight
that's simply been in the file since a previous sitting is never pinned there, however new its own
timestamp looks. Clicking a highlight/note's own text — in
either list — jumps to it in the PDF so you can see which one it is, without closing the box or
changing anything; click **Link** to attach it — its button flips to **×** right there without the row
jumping anywhere, and it moves up into the linked list above the next time you open the box. The 🔗
button shows a count once you've linked one or more (`🔗 2`). A highlight or note can be linked to any
number of fields, and a field can have any number linked to it.

If you highlight or note something and then open a field's 🔗 box right away, that highlight/note links
itself automatically — no need to find and click it. Typing the value into that same field first still
counts as "right away" and links it too. Doing anything else first — editing a different field, adding
or removing an entry, undoing, touching another mark — cancels the offer, and you pick it from the list
by hand instead.

To remove a link, click its × — either in the field's own box, or by opening the highlight/note itself
in the PDF, where its box lists every field it's linked to.

## The completeness dot

Each paper in the list carries a status dot on its left. In an ordinary (non-screening) project, it
fills in proportionally as fields are completed:

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/completeness-dots.png" alt="Paper list showing a partially-filled completeness dot on the first paper, empty dots on the rest" width="280">
</p>

- If the schema marks any fields **required**, the dot's denominator is those required fields only.
- If nothing is marked required, it's a fraction of *all* fields instead — better than nothing rather
  than staying permanently empty.
- Hover a dot (or check its accessible label) for the actual numbers: "3 of 12 fields filled".

The **fill** is always progress; the **color** says whose move it is:

| Dot | State | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| empty | *Not started* | nothing filled in yet |
| amber slice | *In progress* | partly filled |
| solid amber | *Ready to finish* | every counted field is filled, but nobody has said it's done |
| solid green | *Finished* | you ticked **Annotation finished** and it still holds |
| red | *Finished, required fields missing* | ticked while a **required** field is empty — see below |

The dot always tracks **your own seat**: as a numbered reviewer it's your progress and your sign-off,
and in **Consolidation** it's the consolidated record's progress and *your* sign-off on it. Whether
every reviewer has answered a paper yet — the thing that decides if it's workable at all — is in that
dot's tooltip in the Consolidation seat, and counted in the line under "Papers" (`… · 3/10 ready`).
In a **screening** project the dot becomes the tri-state include/exclude/undecided marker described in
[Screening](screening.md) instead.

## Marking a paper finished

A completely filled form is not the same as a finished paper, so SaiLoR does not decide that for
you. The **Annotation finished** checkbox sits at the top of the annotation panel, under the paper's
title, and is always there — tick it when you're done with the paper. Only then does its dot turn
green.

### When red appears

Red means one specific thing: **a field that had to be filled is empty on a paper you called
finished.** "Had to be filled" is the schema's own `required` flag — the same rule
[Validate](#validating) uses — so the red dot and the Validate dialog can never disagree.

- If your schema marks **nothing** required, no paper ever turns red. An unanswered question is
  often the right record of a paper that doesn't address it, and ticking the box says so.
- A **Yes/No** field is never a hole. Unticking it records *no*, which is an answer — it can't turn
  a finished paper red even if the field is marked required. (Same reason Validate never reports a
  Yes/No field as missing.)
- Ticking early — before a required field is filled — is allowed rather than blocked. Sometimes a
  paper genuinely can't be filled in further; the app marks the disagreement instead of hiding it.

The mark is re-evaluated from the current data, live, as you type: **it is not tied to saving.**
Empty a required field on a finished paper and it turns red at once; refill it and it goes green
again. Nothing is ever silently un-ticked — the declaration is yours to withdraw by unticking the
box.

The tick is yours alone: in a multi-reviewer project each reviewer — and Consolidation — has their
own checkbox and their own green dot, saved in their own file. In the Consolidation seat the box reads
**Consolidation finished**, since what you're signing off there is the reconciled record rather than
your own extraction; it is stored with the consolidated result, and says nothing about whether the
reviewers have all answered the paper.

### Turning the checkbox off

If you'd rather not sign papers off by hand, put `"finishCheckbox": false` in the project file's
`config`. Papers then count as finished the moment their schema is fulfilled — all required fields
filled, or all fields where the schema requires nothing — and the checkbox disappears. Nothing can
be red in that mode (there is no declaration left to contradict the data), so the filter drops its
*With issues* option too.

The default is `true`. Ticks recorded before you turned it off stay in the file untouched, so
turning it back on picks up exactly where you left off.

### Where a project opens

Opening a project puts you on the **first paper that isn't finished** — including one showing red —
rather than on paper 1, which on a review you've been working through is something you already
signed off. If every paper is finished, it opens on the first one as before. Screening projects, and
a multi-reviewer project where you haven't picked a seat yet, also open on the first paper: neither
has a per-seat "finished" to go by.

## Filtering by annotation state

The dropdown under the search box narrows the list to one of these buckets:

- **Open** — every paper you have *not* ticked as finished, whatever its dot shows: untouched,
  part-filled, and filled-but-not-yet-signed-off alike. Undo some annotations, or untick the box on a
  paper you had finished, and it comes back here.
- **In progress** — the papers you have actually *started*: those with at least one annotation
  recorded, still not signed off. This is **Open** minus the papers you have not touched yet, so it
  answers "what have I begun and not finished". (A paper whose only entry is a Yes/No answer counts as
  started even though its dot still reads empty — the fill ignores Yes/No fields.)
- **Finished** — ticked and still holding.
- **With issues** — ticked while a required field is empty (the red dots).

The five dot colors are unchanged; the filter is just coarser than they are, since "what still needs
work" is the question you actually ask a list.

The line under "Papers" counts whichever bucket is selected, across the whole project regardless of
the search box: `finished: 5/100`. With no filter set it counts *finished*, the headline number.
Screening projects keep their own include/exclude/undecided filter instead. The Consolidation seat has
the same dropdown and the same counter as any other, plus a second number for how many papers every
reviewer has answered: `finished: 5/100 · 82/100 ready`.

## Validating

**Validate** (in the toolbar) checks every annotated paper against the schema: required fields that
are still empty, values of the wrong type, and enum values outside a dropdown's allowed choices.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/validate-dialog.png" alt="The Validate dialog listing three problems on one paper, and four papers not yet annotated" width="900">
</p>

Click a problem to jump straight to that field. Papers with **no annotations at all** are listed
separately under *Not annotated yet* rather than reported field by field — an untouched paper would
otherwise fail every required field at once and bury the problems that are actually worth looking at.

Note the reminder at the top of the dialog: a *Yes/No* field is never reported as missing, even if
it's marked required — see [Things to know](things-to-know.md#a-smaller-one-a-yesno-field-can-never-be-reported-as-missing).
