        <p>
          Your review is the project JSON file on your own disk, next to its PDFs — the app has no
          account, no server, and no sync.

      </Faq>
      <Faq q="Can two people review the same project at once?">
        <p>
          Not on the same file at the same time — the app has no locking, so two people saving the
          same JSON will overwrite each other. What it does support is{' '}
          <strong>multiple reviewers within one file</strong>: set the reviewer count when you build
          the schema, and each reviewer's answers are kept separately (see{' '}
          <em>Working with several reviewers</em>). Pass the file along, or take turns.
        </p>
      </Faq>
      <Faq q="I moved the JSON and now the PDFs don't load.">
        <p>
          PDFs are referenced <strong>relative to the JSON file</strong>, so the PDFs need to travel
          with it. Moving the JSON with <em>Save as…</em> re-derives the references for you; moving it
          in Finder/Explorer does not. In the browser you'll also be asked once per session to point
          at the folder that holds them.
        </p>
      </Faq>
      <Faq q="Why did my Findings get reordered — and why is my project suddenly unsaved?">
        <p>
          Opening a paper as <strong>Consolidation</strong> lines the reviewers up: it works out which
          of each reviewer's repeated entries are the same entry and puts them in the same order, so
          that everyone's <em>Finding #2</em> means one finding. Without that, comparing #2 against #2
          would pit unrelated findings against each other and report a disagreement that was really
          just a difference of ordering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because that changes the file, it counts as an unsaved change — and it is a single{' '}
          <strong>Undo</strong> away if you would rather keep the original order. Your own values are
          never altered, only their order, and a gap can appear where you recorded nothing for an
          entry the others did. Once you have answered a group in Consolidation, it is left alone.
        </p>
      </Faq>
      <Faq q="Is my work saved automatically?">
        <p>
          No. A dot next to the project name means unsaved changes — press <strong>{MOD}+S</strong>.
          The app asks before you close or quit with unsaved work.

              A project can be set up so that <strong>several reviewers annotate it independently</strong>{' '}
              — the usual way to keep an SLR honest. If it is, the top bar lets you say who you are.
              Each reviewer sees and fills in <strong>only their own answers</strong>; nobody is

            <p>
              Besides the numbered reviewers there is one extra role, <strong>Consolidation</strong>.
              That is not "one more reviewer" — it is the pass where the disagreements get settled.
              In Consolidation, each field gets a compare button that shows{' '}
              <strong>every reviewer's answer side by side</strong>, flags whether they agree, and
              lets you click one to adopt it. What Consolidation records is the project's{' '}
              <strong>final result</strong> — the answers an analysis or export would use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where <strong>every reviewer gave the same answer</strong>, Consolidation fills it in
              for you and marks it with a{' '}
              <strong>light-blue border</strong> until you click it — there is nothing to reconcile
              when everyone already agrees, and copying those across by hand is exactly the task
              during which a real disagreement further down gets missed. Only case and stray spaces
              are forgiven, never near-misses: if the wording genuinely differs, the call stays
              yours. A field one reviewer left blank is not agreement either, however the others
              answered.
            </p>
            <p>
              For fields and groups that can be added several times — Findings, say — Consolidation
              does two things for you as you open a paper. It adds{' '}
              <strong>as many entries as the busiest reviewer recorded</strong>, so you are not
              counting anyone's work by hand. And it works out{' '}
              <strong>which of each reviewer's entries are the same entry</strong>, since two people
              listing the same three findings rarely list them in the same order. Your Finding #2 is
              then everyone's Finding #2, and the compare button lines up answers that are genuinely
              about the same thing instead of reporting a disagreement that was only a difference of
              ordering. Entries are matched on what they say, so wording need not match exactly;
              once you have answered a group, it is left alone rather than re-ordered underneath you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two buttons above the annotation fields belong to Consolidation.{' '}
              <strong>⚠ Disagreements</strong> lists every field the reviewers answered differently
              across the whole project — click one to jump straight to it, rather than hunting paper
              by paper. <strong>⚖ Agreement</strong> reports the usual inter-rater coefficients —{' '}
              <strong>Cohen's κ</strong>, <strong>Fleiss' κ</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>Krippendorff's α</strong> — and you can tick any combination. One that cannot
              honestly be computed for your project is greyed out and tells you why when you hover it,
              rather than quietly reporting a number that would not mean what it appears to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two reviewers can write <em>RCT</em> and <em>randomized controlled trial</em> and mean
              one thing, which no amount of text comparison can know. When you see such a pair in the
              compare popup, tick{' '}
              <strong>"These answers mean the same thing"</strong>: from then on the app counts it as
              agreement — in the badge, in the disagreement list, and in the statistics. It is worth
              doing before you quote a κ anywhere, because until you do, the number understates how
              much your reviewers actually agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ticking it settles <em>that</em> they agreed, not <em>what</em> they agreed on, so{' '}
              <strong>also click one of the answers</strong> to record the value. If you try to leave
              without doing that, the app stops and asks: the field would otherwise count as settled
              while holding nothing, and you would never see it again. Leave anyway and the tick is
              undone, so the field goes back on the disagreement list rather than quietly vanishing
              from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Opening such a project asks who you are before showing you anything — an answer that
              isn't attributable to a reviewer is worse than no answer. It asks once and remembers;
              the toolbar switch changes it whenever you like.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't have to wait for everyone to finish before consolidating: the seat is always
              open, and it is the individual <em>papers</em> that wait. One that not every reviewer
              has annotated yet keeps its <strong>⇄</strong> buttons disabled and says so in its dot's
              tooltip — the missing reviewer's column would otherwise look like they found nothing,
              when the truth is they haven't looked yet. The line under <em>Papers</em> counts those,
              as the <em>… · 3/10 ready</em> half of its text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consolidation signs papers off like any other seat: the checkbox at the top of the panel
              reads <em>Consolidation finished</em>, the paper's dot fills as the consolidated record
              fills and turns green once you tick it, and the filter dropdown narrows the list to what
              you have not settled yet. That tick is yours alone — it is stored with the consolidated
              result and claims nothing about whether the reviewers have all answered the paper.

                A <em>Yes/no</em> field always counts as answered: an unticked box is a real answer
                (<em>no</em>), and the file cannot tell "not answered" apart from "answered no". If
                you need a true third state, use a <em>Text</em> field with fixed choices instead.

                It is flagged, and you should fix it before annotating: a paper needs a PDF to
                review. Importing a bibliography only brings the <em>metadata</em> — attach the file
                with <em>+ Add PDFs…</em> or by typing the path into the row.

            <Faq q="The title or authors came out wrong.">
              <p>
                They are extracted heuristically — from the PDF's own metadata and layout, or from
                the reference file — and papers vary wildly. That is exactly why new rows are marked
                for review. Just type over anything that is wrong; nothing is locked.

            </Faq>
            <Faq q="Can I reuse one schema across several reviews?">
              <p>
                Yes — copy the project JSON, then use <em>Edit annotation JSON…</em> to swap the
                papers out. The schema and the paper list are independent parts of the same file.
